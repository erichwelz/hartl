8.3 Introduction to cucumber

Review/create Cucumbers tests

8.5 Exercises

Test Refactoring exercise:
Following the example in Section 8.3.3, go through the user and authentication request specs (i.e., the files currently in the spec/requests directory) and add methods to spec/support/utilities.rb to decouple the tests from the implementation. Extra credit: Organize the support code into separate files and modules, and get everything to work by including the modules properly in the spec helper file.
